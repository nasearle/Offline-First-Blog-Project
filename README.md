#blog project - responsive

This repo is what the blog-project should look like after the student has added responsive functionality.

We set the viewport with a `<meta>` tag
```sh
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes">
```

And we have also wrapped our `<img>` tags in `<picture>` elements and used **srcset** with **media queries** to select optimal images.
